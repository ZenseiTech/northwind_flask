Single-database configuration for Flask.

If using sqlite, in the migration script alway put this at the beginning of both
upgrade and downgrade:

op.execute("PRAGMA legacy_alter_table=ON")

Also careful when renaming columns, the created script will drop the column and create a new one.
That is not what you want.
